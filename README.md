This project explores various methods for Forecasting Sales with Trend. Each method is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook. The dataset used for this project is available at Kaggle in M5 Competiton page.

Dataset
The dataset for this project is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy
We use three subsets of time series,established as follows: 
a) subset of 300 random time series from the M5 Competition dataset,
b) subset of 130 series classified with trend with a threshold equal to 3 
c) subset of 50 series classified with trend with a threshold equal to 5.
